# Testing Checklist

Track manual verification of each phase before merging to production.
Mark items with `[x]` as you test them, or add notes if something fails.

---

## Phase 1 — Authentication Hardening

### Task 1.1 — Forgot Password Flow

**Setup:** Make sure you have a test account with a known email address.

- [ ] Navigate to `/login` → confirm "Forgot password?" link appears inline with the Password label
- [ ] Click "Forgot password?" → confirm you land on `/forgot-password`
- [ ] Submit a **valid** email address → confirm "Check your inbox" success state appears (email + 1hr note)
- [ ] Confirm you receive the Supabase password reset email in your inbox
- [ ] Click the reset link in the email → confirm you land on `/reset-password` (not "Link expired")
- [ ] Submit **mismatched** passwords → confirm "Passwords do not match" inline error appears
- [ ] Submit a password shorter than 8 characters → confirm "at least 8 characters" error
- [ ] Submit a valid new password → confirm redirect to `/login?message=password-updated`
- [ ] Confirm the green success banner "Password updated successfully" shows on the login page
- [ ] Sign in with the **new** password → confirm it works
- [ ] Sign in with the **old** password → confirm it fails

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Submit a **non-existent** email on `/forgot-password` → confirm success state still shows (Supabase doesn't reveal if email exists — this is correct behavior)
- [ ] Visit `/reset-password` directly (no reset link, no session) → confirm "Link expired or invalid" state with "Request a new link" button
- [ ] Click "Request a new link" on the invalid state → confirm redirect to `/forgot-password`
- [ ] Click "try again" on the success state → confirm form resets so user can submit again

---

### Task 1.2 — Email Verification Enforcement

**Setup:** Create a **new** test account via email/password (do NOT click the verification link yet).

- [ ] After registration → confirm redirect to `/verify-email?email=your@email.com`
- [ ] Confirm the page shows the correct email address
- [ ] Click "Resend verification email" → confirm toast "Verification email sent!"
- [ ] Check your email → confirm a verification email was received
- [ ] **Without verifying**: try accessing `/dashboard` directly → confirm redirect to `/verify-email`
- [ ] **Without verifying**: try accessing `/analytics` directly → confirm redirect to `/verify-email`
- [ ] **Without verifying**: try accessing `/billing` directly → confirm redirect to `/verify-email`
- [ ] Click the verification link in the email → confirm login / redirect to dashboard
- [ ] **After verifying**: access `/dashboard` → confirm it loads normally (no more redirect)

**OAuth users (should NOT be gated):**
- [ ] Sign in with Google → confirm you reach `/dashboard` directly (no `/verify-email` redirect)

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Visit `/verify-email` with no `?email=` param → confirm "Resend" button is disabled
- [ ] Click "Used the wrong email? Start over" → confirm redirect to `/register`

---

### Task 1.3 — Rate Limiting Feedback

**Note:** Supabase rate limits kick in after several rapid attempts. You may need to trigger real rate limits or inspect the error handling logic by temporarily simulating a 429 response.

- [ ] On `/login` (Password tab): submit 10+ rapid failed login attempts → confirm rate-limit message "Too many login attempts. Please wait a moment and try again." appears (not the raw Supabase error)
- [ ] On `/login` (Magic Link tab): send 5+ rapid magic link requests → confirm rate-limit message appears
- [ ] On `/register`: attempt 5+ rapid registrations → confirm rate-limit message appears
- [ ] On `/forgot-password`: submit 5+ rapid reset requests → confirm rate-limit message appears
- [ ] On `/verify-email`: click "Resend" 5+ times rapidly → confirm rate-limit toast appears

---

---

---

## Phase 5 — Analytics Enhancements

### Task 5.1 — Analytics Filters

**Setup:** Sign in with a Premium account that has time entries spanning several weeks.

- [ ] Navigate to `/analytics` → confirm the filter bar appears below the page title
- [ ] Filter bar shows three preset buttons: **7d**, **30d**, **90d**
- [ ] Filter bar shows a **From** date input and a **To** date input
- [ ] No filter active: URL has no `dateFrom` / `dateTo` params; charts show default ranges
- [ ] Click **7d** → URL updates to `?dateFrom=<7 days ago>&dateTo=<today>` → stats + charts update
- [ ] Click **30d** → URL updates accordingly → charts update
- [ ] Click **90d** → URL updates accordingly → charts update
- [ ] Set **From** date manually → URL updates → charts update
- [ ] Set **To** date manually → URL updates → charts update
- [ ] Set both **From** and **To** → charts and KPI cards reflect only that date range
- [ ] **Daily Activity chart title** shows "Daily Activity" (not the hardcoded "Last 30 Days") when filtered
- [ ] **Weekly Hours chart title** shows "Weekly Hours" (not "Last 12 Weeks") when filtered
- [ ] **Clear** button appears when any filter is active → click → URL loses date params → charts revert to defaults
- [ ] **Streak KPI card** always shows current streak regardless of date filter (not filtered)
- [ ] Refresh page with date params in URL → correct filter is still active

**Date range edge cases:**
- [ ] From > To → charts may show empty; no crash
- [ ] Very wide range (e.g. all time) → page renders correctly
- [ ] Malformed date param in URL (e.g. `?dateFrom=notadate`) → safely ignored, defaults used (no 500 error)

---

### Task 5.2 — Analytics Empty States

**Setup:** Use an account with zero tracked entries for the full-page test.

- [ ] **Full-page empty state** (no entries ever): navigate to `/analytics` → confirm "No data yet" message with BarChart icon and a helpful hint; filter bar is hidden
- [ ] **Filtered empty state**: apply a date filter with no entries in that range → confirm compact empty state with BarChart icon + "No entries found for the selected date range." message; stats cards are hidden
- [ ] **Per-chart empty states** (individual charts with no data in range):
  - [ ] Daily Activity: shows BarChart icon + "No activity in the selected period"
  - [ ] Weekly Hours: shows BarChart icon + "No weekly data in the selected period"
  - [ ] Time by Project: shows BarChart icon + "No project data for the selected period"
  - [ ] Time by Entry Type: shows BarChart icon + "No entry type data for the selected period"
  - [ ] Hours by Day of Week: shows BarChart icon + "No day-of-week data for the selected period"

- [ ] Light mode and dark mode render correctly for all empty states
- [ ] Empty states are responsive at 375px mobile width

---

### Phase 5 — SQL Migration

> **Must apply to Supabase before testing the filter feature.**
>
> Run migration `010_analytics_date_filter.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI.

- [ ] After applying migration: `get_user_analytics` with no date params returns same results as before
- [ ] After applying: `get_user_analytics` with `p_date_from` + `p_date_to` returns filtered totals

---

## Phase 6 — UI Polish & Navigation

> Not yet implemented. Tests will be added when Phase 6 is complete.
